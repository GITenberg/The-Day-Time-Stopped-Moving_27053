<div class="center"><b><small>Dave Miller pushed with all his strength, but the girl was as unmovable as Gibraltar.</small></b></div>

<div class="bk3"><i>All Dave Miller wanted to do
was commit suicide in peace.
He tried, but the things that
happened after he'd pulled
the trigger were all wrong.
Like everyone standing around
like statues. No St. Peter, no
pearly gate, no pitchforks
or halos. He might just as
well have saved the bullet!</i></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Dave Miller</span> would never
have done it, had he been
in his right mind. The Millers
were not a melancholy stock,
hardly the sort of people you
expect to read about in the morning
paper who have taken their
lives the night before. But Dave
Miller was drunk&mdash;abominably,
roaringly so&mdash;and the barrel of
the big revolver, as he stood
against the sink, made a ring of
coldness against his right temple.</p>

<p>Dawn was beginning to stain
the frosty kitchen windows. In
the faint light, the letter lay a
gray square against the drain-board
tiles. With the melodramatic
gesture of the very drunk,
Miller had scrawled across the
envelope:</p>

<p>"This is why I did it!"</p>

<p>He had found Helen's letter
in the envelope when he staggered
into their bedroom fifteen
minutes ago&mdash;at a quarter after
five. As had frequently happened
during the past year, he'd come
home from the store a little late
... about twelve hours late, in
fact. And this time Helen had
done what she had long threatened
to do. She had left him.</p>

<p>The letter was brief, containing
a world of heartbreak and
broken hopes.</p>

<p>"I don't mind having to
scrimp, Dave. No woman minds
that if she feels she is really
helping her husband over a
rough spot. When business went
bad a year ago, I told you I was
ready to help in any way I could.
But you haven't let me. You quit
fighting when things got difficult,
and put in all your money and
energy on liquor and horses and
cards. I could stand being married
to a drunkard, Dave, but
not to a coward ..."</p>

<p>So she was trying to show
him. But Miller told himself he'd
show her instead. Coward, eh?
Maybe this would teach her a
lesson! Hell of a lot of help she'd
been! Nag at him every time
he took a drink. Holler bloody
murder when he put twenty-five
bucks on a horse, with a
chance to make five hundred.
What man wouldn't do those
things?</p>

<p>His drug store was on the
skids. Could he be blamed for
drinking a little too much, if
alcohol dissolved the morbid
vapors of his mind?</p>

<p>Miller stiffened angrily, and
tightened his finger on the trigger.
But he had one moment of
frank insight just before the
hammer dropped and brought
the world tumbling about his
ears. It brought with it a realization
that the whole thing was his
fault. Helen was right&mdash;he was
a coward. There was a poignant
ache in his heart. She'd been as
loyal as they came, he knew
that.</p>

<p>He could have spent his nights
thinking up new business tricks,
instead of swilling whiskey.
Could have gone out of his way
to be pleasant to customers, not
snap at them when he had a terrific
hangover. And even Miller
knew nobody ever made any money
on the horses&mdash;at least, not
when he needed it. But horses
and whiskey and business had
become tragically confused in his
mind; so here he was, full of
liquor and madness, with a gun
to his head.</p>

<p>Then again anger swept his
mind clean of reason, and he
threw his chin up and gripped
the gun tight.</p>

<p>"Run out on me, will she!" he
muttered thickly. "Well&mdash;this'll
show her!"</p>

<p>In the next moment the hammer
fell ... and Dave Miller had
"shown her."</p>

<p>Miller opened his eyes with a
start. As plain as black on white,
he'd heard a bell ring&mdash;the most
familiar sound in the world, too.
It was the unmistakable tinkle
of his cash register.</p>

<p>"Now, how in hell&mdash;" The
thought began in his mind; and
then he saw where he was.</p>

<p>The cash register was right in
front of him! It was open, and
on the marble slab lay a customer's
five-spot. Miller's glance
strayed up and around him.</p>

<p>He was behind the drug counter,
all right. There were a man
and a girl sipping cokes at the
fountain, to his right; the magazine
racks by the open door; the
tobacco counter across from the
fountain. And right before him
was a customer.</p>

<p>Good Lord! he thought. Was
all this a&mdash;a dream?</p>

<p>Sweat oozed out on his clammy
forehead. That stuff of Herman's
that he had drunk during
the game&mdash;it had had a rank
taste, but he wouldn't have
thought anything short of marihuana
could produce such hallucinations
as he had just had.
Wild conjectures came boiling up
from the bottom of Miller's being.</p>

<p>How did he get behind the
counter? Who was the woman
he was waiting on? What&mdash;</p>

<p>The woman's curious stare
was what jarred him completely
into the present. Get rid of her!
was his one thought. Then sit
down behind the scenes and try
to figure it all out.</p>

<p>His hand poised over the cash
drawer. Then he remembered he
didn't know how much he was
to take out of the five. Avoiding
the woman's glance, he muttered:</p>

<p>"Let's see, now, that was&mdash;uh&mdash;how
much did I say?"</p>

<p>The woman made no answer.
Miller cleared his throat, said
uncertainly:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, ma'am&mdash;did
I say&mdash;seventy-five cents?"</p>

<p>It was just a feeler, but the
woman didn't even answer to
that. And it was right then that
Dave Miller noticed the deep
silence that brooded in the store.</p>

<p>Slowly his head came up and
he looked straight into the woman's
eyes. She returned him a
cool, half-smiling glance. But her
eyes neither blinked nor moved.
Her features were frozen. Lips
parted, teeth showing a little,
the tip of her tongue was between
her even white teeth as though
she had started to say "this"
and stopped with the syllable unspoken.</p>

<p>Muscles began to rise behind
Miller's ears. He could feel his
hair stiffen like filings drawn to
a magnet. His glance struggled
to the soda fountain. What he
saw there shook him to the core
of his being.</p>

<p>The girl who was drinking a
coke had the glass to her lips, but
apparently she wasn't sipping
the liquid. Her boy friend's glass
was on the counter. He had
drawn on a cigarette and exhaled
the gray smoke. That smoke
hung in the air like a large,
elongated balloon with the small
end disappearing between his
lips. While Miller stared, the
smoke did not stir in the slightest.</p>

<p>There was something unholy,
something supernatural, about
this scene!</p>

<p>With apprehension rippling
down his spine, Dave Miller
reached across the cash register
and touched the woman on the
cheek. The flesh was warm, but
as hard as flint. Tentatively, the
young druggist pushed harder;
finally, shoved with all his might.
For all the result, the woman
might have been a two-ton
bronze statue. She neither budged
nor changed expression.</p>

<p>Panic seized Miller. His voice
hit a high hysterical tenor as he
called to his soda-jerker.</p>

<p>"Pete! <i>Pete!</i>" he shouted.
"What in God's name is wrong
here!"</p>

<p>The blond youngster, with a
towel wadded in a glass, did not
stir. Miller rushed from the back
of the store, seized the boy by
the shoulders, tried to shake him.
But Pete was rooted to the spot.</p>

<p>Miller knew, now, that what
was wrong was something greater
than a hallucination or a
hangover. He was in some kind
of trap. His first thought was to
rush home and see if Helen was
there. There was a great sense
of relief when he thought of her.
Helen, with her grave blue eyes
and understanding manner,
would listen to him and know
what was the matter.</p>

<hr />

<p>He left the haunted drug
store at a run, darted around the
corner and up the street to his
car. But, though he had not
locked the car, the door resisted
his twisting grasp. Shaking,
pounding, swearing, Miller
wrestled with each of the doors.</p>

<p>Abruptly he stiffened, as a
horrible thought leaped into his
being. His gaze left the car and
wandered up the street. Past the
intersection, past the one beyond
that, on up the thoroughfare until
the gray haze of the city dimmed
everything. And as far as
Dave Miller could see, there was
no trace of motion.</p>

<p>Cars were poised in the street,
some passing other machines,
some turning corners. A street
car stood at a safety zone; a man
who had leaped from the bottom
step hung in space a foot above
the pavement. Pedestrians
paused with one foot up. A bird
hovered above a telephone pole,
its wings glued to the blue vault
of the sky.</p>

<p>With a choked sound, Miller
began to run. He did not slacken
his pace for fifteen minutes, until
around him were the familiar,
reassuring trees and shrub-bordered
houses of his own
street. But yet how strange to
him!</p>

<p>The season was autumn, and
the air filled with brown and
golden leaves that tossed on a
frozen wind. Miller ran by two
boys lying on a lawn, petrified
into a modern counterpart of the
sculptor's "The Wrestlers." The
sweetish tang of burning leaves
brought a thrill of terror to him;
for, looking down an alley from
whence the smoke drifted, he
saw a man tending a fire whose
leaping flames were red tongues
that did not move.</p>

<p>Sobbing with relief, the young
druggist darted up his own walk.
He tried the front door, found
it locked, and jammed a thumb
against the doorbell. But of
course the little metal button
was as immovable as a mountain.
So in the end, after convincing
himself that the key could not
be inserted into the lock, he
sprang toward the back.</p>

<p>The screen door was not latched,
but it might as well have
been the steel door of a bank
vault. Miller began to pound on
it, shouting:</p>

<p>"Helen! Helen, are you in
there? My God, dear, there's
something wrong! You've got
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>The silence that flowed in again
when his voice choked off
was the dead stillness of the
tomb. He could hear his voice
rustling through the empty
rooms, and at last it came back
to him like a taunt: "<i>Helen!
Helen!</i>"</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br />
<i>Time Stands Still</i></h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">For</span> Dave Miller, the world
was now a planet of death
on which he alone lived and
moved and spoke. Staggered, utterly
beaten, he made no attempt
to break into his home. But he
did stumble around to the kitchen
window and try to peer in,
anxious to see if there was a
body on the floor. The room was
in semi-darkness, however, and
his straining eyes made out
nothing.</p>

<p>He returned to the front of
the house, shambling like a somnambulist.
Seated on the porch
steps, head in hands, he slipped
into a hell of regrets. He knew
now that his suicide had been no
hallucination. He was dead, all
right; and this must be hell or
purgatory.</p>

<p>Bitterly he cursed his drinking,
that had led him to such a
mad thing as suicide. Suicide!
He&mdash;Dave Miller&mdash;a coward who
had taken his own life! Miller's
whole being crawled with revulsion.
If he just had the last year
to live over again, he thought
fervently.</p>

<p>And yet, through it all, some
inner strain kept trying to tell
him he was not dead. This was
his own world, all right, and essentially
unchanged. What had
happened to it was beyond the
pale of mere guesswork. But this
one thing began to be clear:
This was a world in which
change or motion of any kind
was a foreigner.</p>

<hr />

<p>Fire would not burn and
smoke did not rise. Doors would
not open, liquids were solid. Miller's
stubbing toe could not move
a pebble, and a blade of grass
easily supported his weight without bending.
In other words, Miller
began to understand, change
had been stopped as surely as if
a master hand had put a finger
on the world's balance wheel.</p>

<p>Miller's ramblings were terminated
by the consciousness
that he had an acute headache.
His mouth tasted, as Herman
used to say after a big night, as
if an army had camped in it.
Coffee and a bromo were what
he needed.</p>

<p>But it was a great awakening
to him when he found a restaurant
and learned that he could
neither drink the coffee nor get
the lid off the bromo bottle. Fragrant
coffee-steam hung over the
glass percolator, but even this
steam was as a brick wall to his
probing touch. Miller started
gloomily to thread his way
through the waiters in back of
the counter again.</p>

<p>Moments later he stood in the
street and there were tears
swimming in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Helen!" His voice was a
pleading whisper. "Helen, honey,
where are you?"</p>

<p>There was no answer but the
pitiful palpitation of utter silence.
And then, there was movement
at Dave Miller's right!</p>

<p>Something shot from between
the parked cars and crashed
against him; something brown
and hairy and soft. It knocked
him down. Before he could get
his breath, a red, wet tongue was
licking his face and hands, and
he was looking up into the face
of a police dog!</p>

<p>Frantic with joy at seeing another
in this city of death, the
dog would scarcely let Miller
rise. It stood up to plant big
paws on his shoulders and try
to lick his face. Miller laughed
out loud, a laugh with a throaty
catch in it.</p>

<p>"Where'd you come from,
boy?" he asked. "Won't they talk
to you, either? What's your
name, boy?"</p>

<p>There was a heavy, brass-studded
collar about the animal's
neck, and Dave Miller read on its
little nameplate: "Major."</p>

<p>"Well, Major, at least we've
got company now," was Miller's
sigh of relief.</p>

<p>For a long time he was too
busy with the dog to bother
about the sobbing noises. Apparently
the dog failed to hear them,
for he gave no sign. Miller
scratched him behind the ear.</p>

<p>"What shall we do now, Major?
Walk? Maybe your nose can
smell out another friend for us."</p>

<p>They had gone hardly two
blocks when it came to him that
there was a more useful way of
spending their time. The library!
Half convinced that the
whole trouble stemmed from his
suicide shot in the head&mdash;which
was conspicuously absent now&mdash;he
decided that a perusal of the
surgery books in the public library
might yield something he
could use.</p>

<hr />

<p>That way they bent their
steps, and were soon mounting
the broad cement stairs of the
building. As they went beneath
the brass turnstile, the librarian
caught Miller's attention with a
smiling glance. He smiled back.</p>

<p>"I'm trying to find something
on brain surgery," he explained.
"I&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a shock, then, he realized
he had been talking to himself.</p>

<p>In the next instant, Dave Miller
whirled. A voice from the
bookcases chuckled:</p>

<p>"If you find anything, I wish
you'd let me know. I'm stumped
myself!"</p>

<hr />

<p>From a corner of the room
came an elderly, half-bald man
with tangled gray brows and a
rueful smile. A pencil was balanced
over his ear, and a note-book
was clutched in his hand.</p>

<p>"You, too!" he said. "I had
hoped I was the only one&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miller went forward hurriedly
to grip his hand.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'm not so unselfish,"
he admitted. "I've been
hoping for two hours that I'd
run into some other poor soul."</p>

<p>"Quite understandable," the
stranger murmured sympathetically.
"But in my case it is different.
You see&mdash;I am responsible
for this whole tragic business!"</p>

<p>"You!" Dave Miller gulped the
word. "I&mdash;I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man wagged his head,
staring at his note pad, which
was littered with jumbled calculations.
Miller had a chance to
study him. He was tall, heavily
built, with wide, sturdy shoulders
despite his sixty years. Oddly,
he wore a gray-green smock.
His eyes, narrowed and intent,
looked gimlet-sharp beneath
those toothbrush brows of his, as
he stared at the pad.</p>

<p>"There's the trouble, right
there," he muttered. "I provided
only three stages of amplification,
whereas four would have
been barely enough. No wonder
the phase didn't carry through!"</p>

<p>"I guess I don't follow you,"
Miller faltered. "You mean&mdash;something
you did&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I should think it was something
I did!" The baldish stranger
scratched his head with the
tip of his pencil. "I'm John
Erickson&mdash;you know, the Wanamaker
Institute."</p>

<p>Miller said: "Oh!" in an understanding
voice. Erickson was
head of Wanamaker Institute,
first laboratory of them all when
it came to exploding atoms and
blazing trails into the wildernesses
of science.</p>

<hr />

<p>Erickson's piercing eyes were
suddenly boring into the younger
man.</p>

<p>"You've been sick, haven't
you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;no&mdash;not really sick."
The druggist colored. "I'll have
to admit to being drunk a few
hours ago, though."</p>

<p>"Drunk&mdash;" Erickson stuck his
tongue in his cheek, shook his
head, scowled. "No, that would
hardly do it. There must have
been something else. The impulsor
isn't <i>that</i> powerful. I can
understand about the dog, poor
fellow. He must have been run
over, and I caught him just at
the instant of passing from life
to death."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Dave Miller lifted his
head, knowing now what Erickson
was driving at. "Well, I may
as well be frank. I'm&mdash;I committed
suicide. That's how drunk I
was. There hasn't been a suicide
in the Miller family in centuries.
It took a skinful of liquor to set
the precedent."</p>

<p>Erickson nodded wisely. "Perhaps
we will find the precedent
hasn't really been set! But no
matter&mdash;" His lifted hand stopped
Miller's eager, wondering exclamation.
"The point is, young
man, we three are in a tough
spot, and it's up to us to get out
of it. And not only we, but heaven
knows how many others the
world over!"</p>

<p>"Would you&mdash;maybe you can
explain to my lay mind what's
happened," Miller suggested.</p>

<p>"Of course. Forgive me. You
see, Mr.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miller. Dave Miller."</p>

<p>"Dave it is. I have a feeling
we're going to be pretty well
acquainted before this is over.
You see, Dave, I'm a nut on so-called
'time theories.' I've seen
time compared to everything
from an entity to a long, pink
worm. But I disagree with them
all, because they postulate the
idea that time is constantly being
manufactured. Such reasoning
is fantastic!</p>

<p>"Time exists. Not as an ever-growing
chain of links, because
such a chain would have to have
a tail end, if it has a front end;
and who can imagine the period
when time did not exist? So I
think time is like a circular
train-track. Unending. We who
live and die merely travel around
on it. The future exists simultaneously
with the past, for one
instant when they meet."</p>

<hr />

<p>Miller's brain was humming.
Erickson shot the words at him
staccato-fashion, as if they were
things known from Great Primer
days. The young druggist
scratched his head.</p>

<p>"You've got me licked," he admitted.
"I'm a stranger here,
myself."</p>

<p>"Naturally you can't be expected
to understand things I've
been all my life puzzling about.
Simplest way I can explain it is
that we are on a train following
this immense circular railway.</p>

<p>"When the train reaches the
point where it started, it is about
to plunge into the past; but this
is impossible, because the point
where it started is simply the
caboose of the train! And that
point is always ahead&mdash;and behind&mdash;the
time-train.</p>

<p>"Now, my idea was that with
the proper stimulus a man could
be thrust across the diameter of
this circular railway to a point
in his past. Because of the nature
of time, he could neither go
ahead of the train to meet the
future nor could he stand still
and let the caboose catch up with
him. But&mdash;he could detour
across the circle and land farther
back on the train! And that, my
dear Dave, is what you and I
and Major have done&mdash;almost."</p>

<p>"Almost?" Miller said hoarsely.</p>

<p>Erickson pursed his lips. "We
are somewhere partway across
the space between present and
past. We are living in an instant
that can move neither forward
nor back. You and I, Dave, and
Major&mdash;and the Lord knows how
many others the world over&mdash;have
been thrust by my time impulsor
onto a timeless beach of
eternity. We have been caught in
time's backwash. Castaways, you
might say."</p>

<p>An objection clamored for attention
in Miller's mind.</p>

<p>"But if this is so, where are
the rest of them? Where is my
wife?"</p>

<p>"They are right here," Erickson
explained. "No doubt you
could see your wife if you could
find her. But we see them as
statues, because, for us, time no
longer exists. But there was
something I did not count on. I
did not know that it would be
possible to live in one small instant
of time, as we are doing.
And I did not know that only
those who are hovering between
life and death can deviate from
the normal process of time!"</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;we're dead!"
Miller's voice was a bitter monotone.</p>

<p>"Obviously not. We're talking
and moving, aren't we? But&mdash;we
are on the fence. When I
gave my impulsor the jolt of
high power, it went wrong and
I think something must have
happened to me. At the same instant,
you had shot yourself.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Dave, you are dying.
The only way for us to find
out is to try to get the machine
working and topple ourselves one
way or the other. If we fall back,
we will all live. If we fall into
the present&mdash;we may die."</p>

<p>"Either way, it's better than
this!" Miller said fervently.</p>

<p>"I came to the library here,
hoping to find out the things I
must know. My own books are
locked in my study. And these&mdash;they
might be cemented in their
places, for all their use to me. I
suppose we might as well go back
to the lab."</p>

<p>Miller nodded, murmuring:
"Maybe you'll get an idea when
you look at the machine again."</p>

<p>"Let's hope so," said Erickson
grimly. "God knows I've failed
so far!"</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III<br />
<i>Splendid Sacrifice</i></h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It was</span> a solid hour's walk out
to West Wilshire, where the
laboratory was. The immense
bronze and glass doors of Wanamaker
Institute were closed, and
so barred to the two men. But
Erickson led the way down the
side.</p>

<p>"We can get in a service door.
Then we climb through transoms
and ventilators until we
get to my lab."</p>

<p>Major frisked along beside
them. He was enjoying the action
and the companionship. It
was less of an adventure to Miller,
who knew death might be
ahead for the three of them.</p>

<p>Two workmen were moving a
heavy cabinet in the side service
door. To get in, they climbed
up the back of the rear workman,
walked across the cabinet,
and scaled down the front of the
leading man. They went up the
stairs to the fifteenth floor. Here
they crawled through a transom
into the wing marked:</p>

<p>"Experimental. Enter Only By
Appointment."</p>

<p>Major was helped through it,
then they were crawling along
the dark metal tunnel of an air-conditioning
ventilator. It was
small, and took some wriggling.</p>

<p>In the next room, they were
confronted by a stern receptionist
on whose desk was a little
brass sign, reading:</p>

<p>"Have you an appointment?"</p>

<p>Miller had had his share of
experience with receptionists'
ways, in his days as a pharmaceutical
salesman. He took the
greatest pleasure now in lighting
his cigarette from a match
struck on the girl's nose. Then he
blew the smoke in her face and
hastened to crawl through the
final transom.</p>

<p>John Erickson's laboratory
was well lighted by a glass-brick
wall and a huge skylight. The
sun's rays glinted on the time
impulsor.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The scientist explained
the impulsor in concise terms.
When he had finished, Dave Miller
knew just as little as before,
and the outfit still resembled
three transformers in a line, of
the type seen on power-poles,
connected to a great bronze globe
hanging from the ceiling.</p>

<p>"There's the monster that put
us in this plight," Erickson
grunted. "Too strong to be legal,
too weak to do the job right.
Take a good look!"</p>

<hr />

<p>With his hands jammed in
his pockets, he frowned at the
complex machinery. Miller stared
a few moments; then transferred
his interests to other things in
the room. He was immediately
struck by the resemblance of a
transformer in a far corner to
the ones linked up with the impulsor.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he asked
quickly. "Looks the same as the
ones you used over there."</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"But&mdash; Didn't you say all you
needed was another stage of
power?"</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"Maybe I'm crazy!" Miller
stared from impulsor to transformer
and back again. "Why
don't you use it, then?"</p>

<p>"Using what for the connection?"
Erickson's eyes gently
mocked him.</p>

<p>"Wire, of course!"</p>

<p>The scientist jerked a thumb
at a small bale of heavy copper
wire.</p>

<p>"Bring it over and we'll try
it."</p>

<p>Miller was halfway to it when
he brought up short. Then a
sheepish grin spread over his
features.</p>

<p>"I get it," he chuckled. "That
bale of wire might be the Empire
State Building, as far as
we're concerned. Forgive my
stupidity."</p>

<p>Erickson suddenly became
serious.</p>

<p>"I'd like to be optimistic,
Dave," he muttered, "but in all
fairness to you I must tell you
I see no way out of this. The
machine is, of course, still
working, and with that extra
stage of power, the uncertainty
would be over. But where, in this
world of immovable things, will
we find a piece of wire twenty-five
feet long?"</p>

<hr />

<p>There was a warm, moist sensation
against Miller's hand, and
when he looked down Major
stared up at him commiseratingly.
Miller scratched him behind
the ear, and the dog closed his
eyes, reassured and happy. The
young druggist sighed, wishing
there were some giant hand to
scratch him behind the ear and
smooth <i>his</i> troubles over.</p>

<p>"And if we don't get out," he
said soberly, "we'll starve, I suppose."</p>

<p>"No, I don't think it will be
that quick. I haven't felt any
hunger. I don't expect to. After
all, our bodies are still living in
one instant of time, and a man
can't work up a healthy appetite
in one second. Of course,
this elastic-second business precludes
the possibility of disease.</p>

<p>"Our bodies must go on unchanged.
The only hope I see is&mdash;when
we are on the verge of
madness, suicide. That means
jumping off a bridge, I suppose.
Poison, guns, knives&mdash;all the
usual wherewithal&mdash;are denied
to us."</p>

<p>Black despair closed down on
Dave Miller. He thrust it back,
forcing a crooked grin.</p>

<p>"Let's make a bargain," he
offered. "When we finish fooling
around with this apparatus, we
split up. We'll only be at each
other's throat if we stick together.
I'll be blaming you for my
plight, and I don't want to. It's
my fault as much as yours. How
about it?"</p>

<p>John Erickson gripped his
hand. "You're all right, Dave.
Let me give you some advice. If
ever you do get back to the present
... keep away from liquor.
Liquor and the Irish never did
mix. You'll have that store on
its feet again in no time."</p>

<p>"Thanks!" Miller said fervently.
"And I think I can promise
that nothing less than a
whiskey antidote for snake bite
will ever make me bend an elbow
again!"</p>

<hr />

<p>For the next couple of hours,
despondency reigned in the laboratory.
But it was soon to be
deposed again by hope.</p>

<p>Despite all of Erickson's scientific
training, it was Dave Miller
himself who grasped the
down-to-earth idea that started
them hoping again. He was walking
about the lab, jingling keys
in his pocket, when suddenly he
stopped short. He jerked the
ring of keys into his hand.</p>

<p>"Erickson!" he gasped. "We've
been blind. Look at this!"</p>

<p>The scientist looked; but he
remained puzzled.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;?" he asked skeptically.</p>

<p>"There's our wire!" Dave Miller
exclaimed. "You've got keys;
I've got keys. We've got coins,
knives, wristwatches. Why can't
we lay them all end to end&mdash;"</p>

<p>Erickson's features looked as
if he had been electrically
shocked.</p>

<p>"You've hit it!" he cried. "If
we've got enough!"</p>

<p>With one accord, they began
emptying their pockets, tearing
off wristwatches, searching for
pencils. The finds made a little
heap in the middle of the floor.
Erickson let his long fingers
claw through thinning hair.</p>

<p>"God give us enough! We'll
only need the one wire. The
thing is plugged in already and
only the positive pole has to be
connected to the globe. Come
on!"</p>

<p>Scooping up the assortment of
metal articles, they rushed
across the room. With his pocket-knife,
Dave Miller began breaking
up the metal wrist-watch
straps, opening the links out so
that they could be laid end-to-end
for the greatest possible
length. They patiently broke the
watches to pieces, and of the
junk they garnered made a ragged
foot and a half of "wire."
Their coins stretched the line
still further.</p>

<p>They had ten feet covered before
the stuff was half used up.
Their metal pencils, taken apart,
gave them a good two feet. Key
chains helped generously. With
eighteen feet covered, their progress
began to slow down.</p>

<p>Perspiration poured down Miller's
face. Desperately, he tore
off his lodge ring and cut it in
two to pound it flat. From garters
and suspenders they won a
few inches more. And then&mdash;they
stopped&mdash;feet from their goal.</p>

<p>Miller groaned. He tossed his
pocket-knife in his hand.</p>

<p>"We can get a foot out of
this," he estimated. "But that
still leaves us way short."</p>

<p>Abruptly, Erickson snapped
his fingers.</p>

<p>"Shoes!" he gasped. "They're
full of nails. Get to work with
that knife, Dave. We'll cut out
every one of 'em!"</p>

<hr />

<p>In ten minutes, the shoes were
reduced to ragged piles of tattered
leather. Erickson's deft
fingers painstakingly placed the
nails, one by one, in the line. The
distance left to cover was less
than six inches!</p>

<p>He lined up the last few nails.
Then both men were sinking
back on their heels, as they saw
there was a gap of three inches to
cover!</p>

<p>"Beaten!" Erickson ground
out. "By three inches! Three
inches from the present ... and
yet it might as well be a million
miles!"</p>

<p>Miller's body felt as though it
were in a vise. His muscles
ached with strain. So taut were
his nerves that he leaped as
though stung when Major
nuzzled a cool nose into his hand
again. Automatically, he began
to stroke the dog's neck.</p>

<p>"Well, that licks us," he muttered.
"There isn't another piece
of movable metal in the world."</p>

<p>Major kept whimpering and
pushing against him. Annoyed,
the druggist shoved him away.</p>

<p>"Go 'way," he muttered. "I
don't feel like&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly then his eyes widened,
as his touch encountered
warm metal. He whirled.</p>

<p>"There it is!" he yelled. "The
last link. <i>The nameplate on Major's
collar!</i>"</p>

<p>In a flash, he had torn the little
rectangular brass plate from the
dog collar. Erickson took it from
his grasp. Sweat stood shiny on
his skin. He held the bit of metal
over the gap between wire and
pole.</p>

<p>"This is it!" he smiled brittlely.
"We're on our way, Dave.
Where, I don't know. To death,
or back to life. But&mdash;we're going!"</p>

<p>The metal clinked into place.
Live, writhing power leaped
through the wire, snarling
across partial breaks. The transformers
began to hum. The humming
grew louder. Singing softly,
the bronze globe over their
heads glowed green. Dave Miller
felt a curious lightness. There
was a snap in his brain, and
Erickson, Major and the laboratory
faded from his senses.</p>

<p>Then came an interval when
the only sound was the soft sobbing
he had been hearing as if
in a dream. That, and blackness
that enfolded him like soft velvet.
Then Miller was opening his
eyes, to see the familiar walls
of his own kitchen around him!</p>

<p>Someone cried out.</p>

<p>"Dave! Oh, Dave, dear!"</p>

<p>It was Helen's voice, and it
was Helen who cradled his head
in her lap and bent her face
close to his.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank God that you're
alive&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Helen!" Miller murmured.
"What&mdash;are&mdash;you&mdash;doing here?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't go through with it.
I&mdash;I just couldn't leave you. I
came back and&mdash;and I heard the
shot and ran in. The doctor
should be here. I called him five
minutes ago."</p>

<p>"<i>Five minutes</i> ... How long
has it been since I shot myself?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just six or seven minutes.
I called the doctor right away."</p>

<p>Miller took a deep breath.
Then it <i>must</i> have been a dream.
All that&mdash;to happen in a few
minutes&mdash; It wasn't possible!</p>

<p>"How&mdash;how could I have
botched the job?" he muttered. "I
wasn't drunk enough to miss myself
completely."</p>

<p>Helen looked at the huge revolver
lying in the sink.</p>

<p>"Oh, that old forty-five of
Grandfather's! It hasn't been
loaded since the Civil War. I
guess the powder got damp or
something. It just sort of sputtered
instead of exploding properly.
Dave, promise me something!
You won't ever do anything
like this again, if I promise
not to nag you?"</p>

<p>Dave Miller closed his eyes.
"There won't be any need to nag,
Helen. Some people take a lot of
teaching, but I've had my lesson.
I've got ideas about the
store which I'd been too lazy to
try out. You know, I feel more
like fighting right now than I
have for years! We'll lick 'em,
won't we, honey?"</p>

<p>Helen buried her face in the
hollow of his shoulder and cried
softly. Her words were too
muffled to be intelligible. But
Dave Miller understood what she
meant.</p>

<hr />

<p>He had thought the whole
thing a dream&mdash;John Erickson,
the "time impulsor" and Major.
But that night he read an item
in the <i>Evening Courier</i> that was
to keep him thinking for many
days.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">POLICE INVESTIGATE
DEATH OF SCIENTIST
HERE IN LABORATORY</p>

<p>John M. Erickson, director
of the Wanamaker Institute,
died at his work last
night. Erickson was a beloved
and valuable figure in
the world of science, famous
for his recently publicized
"time lapse" theory.</p>

<p>Two strange circumstances
surrounded his
death. One was the presence
of a German shepherd dog
in the laboratory, its head
crushed as if with a sledgehammer.
The other was a
chain of small metal objects
stretching from one corner
of the room to the other, as
if intended to take the place
of wire in a circuit.</p>

<p>Police, however, discount
this idea, as there was a roll
of wire only a few feet from
the body.</p></div>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
